Portfolio 2:

Installing Dependencies:
  To run this application, you must first install Node.js.
  You can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/
  
  After installing Node.js on your system, you must use it
  to install the packages necessary to run this application.
  From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root
  directory of this project. Next, enter the command:
    
    $ npm install
    
  Running this command will download the dependancies for
  this application into the folder nodes_modules. If this
  folder does not exist, it will create itself.
  
Running Application:
  As this app utilizes php, we will need to run it through
  an apache server. If you have uWamp, simply place the
  contents of the root directory (after installing the
  dependencies) into the 'www' folder. You are now set
  to run the application.
